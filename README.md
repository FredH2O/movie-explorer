# Media Gallery â€” Next.js Project

This is a Next.js app built with `create-next-app` that showcases a dynamic movie gallery powered by OMDb API.

## Key Techniques

- **Next.js (App Router):** Server/client components for fast, SEO-friendly pages.
- **React + TypeScript:** Strong typing with modern React hooks for state and effects.
- **Framer Motion:** Smooth, page-aware animations with `AnimatePresence` and keyed motion components for transitions on pagination and modal views.
- **Context API:** Shared state management for search terms, theme switching, and favourites.
- **Responsive Design:** Mobile-first approach with a fullscreen animated burger menu and desktop navigation.
- **API Integration:** Custom hooks to fetch movie search results and detailed info with graceful loading/error states.
